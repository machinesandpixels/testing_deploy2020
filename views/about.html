                        Our story starts a few years back. Our founder, The Original Hound! Had a casual Doctor's appointment and was strongly advised that if he didn't stop eating greasy Hamburgers and Fries he would die prematurely of heart attack.
                        
                        The Original Hound sure took the advice serious and started his own Greasy Burger Joint. His Doctor warned him about this so you know what he did? He got a new fucking Doctor. Welcome, Round Hounds!
